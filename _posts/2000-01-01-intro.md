# Course overview
{: .text-blue}

This course is intended to give students an overview of the theory and practical aspects of fitting time series models to fisheries and environmental data. The course will cover topics ranging from autocorrelation and crosscorrelation, autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models, univariate and multivariate state-space models, and estimating model parameters. This course also covers various aspects of assessing model performance and evaluating model diagnostics. The course is focused almost exclusively on problems and analyses in the time domain, and only briefly addresses methods for the frequency domain. In general, students will focus on conceptualizing analyses, implementing analyses, and making inference from the results.

# Learning objectives
{: .text-blue}

By the end of the semester, students should be able to:

- Understand the elements to classical decomposition
- Understand how to use ACF and PACF to identify orders of ARMA(p,q) models for time series data
- Apply appropriate diagnostic measures to identify any shortcomings in model assumptions
- Understand how to use information theoretic methods and cross validation for model selection
- Understand how to combine state and observation models into a state-space model
- Use multivariate time series models with covariates to identify influential explanatory variables and do perturbation analyses
- Use Dynamic Factor Analysis to identify common patterns among many time series
- Use Dynamic Linear Models to allow for changing relationships between a response variable and any explanatory variable(s)
- Prepare forecasts with uncertainty using time series models

# Pre-requisites
{: .text-blue}

Students should have a working knowledge of the R computing software. Students should also have an understanding of basic probability and statistical inference.

#Teaching methodology
This course will introduce new material primarily through prepared slides and hands-on demonstrations. Students will be expected to work both individually and collaboratively (to the extent possible given the current conditions); course content and evaluation will emphasize the communication of ideas and the ability to think critically more so than a specific pathway or method. Other areas of this website provide an overview of the topics to be covered, including links to weekly reading assignments, lecture materials, computer labs, and homework assignments.
