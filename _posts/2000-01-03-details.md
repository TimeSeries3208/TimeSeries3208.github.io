# Homework

The homework for each week is listed with the Computer Labs.

## Homework format
Please submit your homework as an Rmarkdown document (.Rmd), which will allow you to combine text, equations, and R code into a pdf or html file. The easiest way to do so is to use the built-in capabilities of RStudio. For those unfamiliar with Rmarkdown, there is a nice introduction here on the [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). There is also help available in RStudio. Please use the template below when submitting your homework. Email your file(s) to the instructor indicated for each week.
